## `local ucdn = require'ucdn'`

A ffi binding of [UCDN][UCDN lib].

UCDN is a Unicode support library. Currently, it provides access
to basic character properties contained in the Unicode Character
Database and low-level normalization functions (pairwise canonical
composition/decomposition and compatibility decomposition). More
functionality might be provided in the future, such as additional
properties, string normalization and encoding conversion.
